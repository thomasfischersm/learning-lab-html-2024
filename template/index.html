  <h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>
  <h2>Technique Over Choreography</h2>
  <p>In our Sensual Bachata Learning Lab, the focus is on mastering dance techniques rather than memorizing choreography. We believe in building a strong foundation that enables you to express yourself freely on the dance floor. This approach ensures that you develop essential skills for improvisation and true artistry in your dancing.</p>
  <h2>Neuroscience-Backed Learning</h2>
  <p>Our unique teaching method is rooted in neuroscience, emphasizing external focus and implicit learning. This approach speeds up your learning process, ensuring more intuitive and fluid movement. You'll find your body and mind syncing more naturally with the music, making every dance a deeper, more enjoyable experience.</p>
  <h2>Embodying Dance: A Somatic Approach to Bachata</h2>
  <p>In the Sensual Bachata Learning Lab, we adopt a somatic approach to dance, emphasizing the integration of movement, music, and emotion. This holistic methodology focuses not just on teaching steps but on how your body feels and responds to the rhythm and emotional currents of bachata. We guide you to be attuned to your movements and the music, encouraging a deeper connection with your dance partner. It's about experiencing the dance from within, letting the music and emotions guide you, and finding harmony between you, your partner, and the beat. </p>

  <h1>What is Sensual Bachata?</h1>
  <p>Sensual Bachata originated in the Dominican Republic and was reinvented in Spain. The popularity comes from the wide variety of bachata music because it's essentially Latin pop music. Unique aspects are the tap instead of a step on the fourth beat and sensual body movements: body waves, hip rolls, dips, and so on.</p>
  <p><b>As an improvised dance,</b> the leader invents a choreography in the moment. As the follower has to find out in the moment what to dance, the leading and following system is highly developed.</p>
  <p><b>As a Mergenue-based dance,</b> the dance comes alive through the hip, chest, and body movements. Moving the entire body is essential to dancing sensual bachata.</p>
  <p><b>As a Latin dance,</b> styling is pervasive. The dancers alter and add the movements to express their own aesthetics and to capture the music.</p>

	<p>Our curriculum focuses on several key dimensions to transform you into a versatile dancer.</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Leading Technique:</strong> Beginning with basic lead signals and progressing to nuanced, complex conversational leading adjusted to your partner.</li>
		<li><strong>Following Technique:</strong> Followers start by learning the basic rules, developing increasing responsivenes to create beautiful movements with styling injected.</li>
		<li><strong>Movement Technique:</strong> Dancers start by developing body coordination, then learning hip, sensual movements, and so on. The study of movement quality is continues forever because it underpins the ability to lead/follow and connect with the music.</li>
		<li><strong>Ear training/Musicality:</strong> Building a foundation of recognizing the beat, musical phases, and syncopation leads to higher level skills like matching the dance and music texture, underpinning the dance with contraction/relase</li>
		<li><strong>Sensual Bachata Vocabulary:</strong> The vocabulary are the common patterns like the basics, types of turns, types of body waves, and so on.</li>
		<li><strong>Choreography Development and Floorcraft:</strong> Specifically for leaders, this dimension hones the skill of crafting choreographies on the fly and adapting to the social dance floor's dynamic environment.</li>

<article class="content" id="neuroscience">
  <h1>Neuroscience-Based Teaching</h1>
  <p>Today, the standard in bachata dance instruction is still based on an instructor wanting a student to move in a certain way and telling the student to move in that way. Over the last two decades, two hundred scientific studies have shed light on how humans learn movement and dance best. Confirmed in many studies, small changes in teaching can increase learning by 50% and more significant changes can make students learn five times faster!</p>
	<p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Internal vs. external focus:</strong> Most people can walk into a dance studio perfectly fine. However, when they are asked to dance forward, left-right-left-right, they become stiff and get confused after every step on which foot to use next. What’s happening is cognitive interference. When you think about the body parts that you move (= internal focus), you interfere with the natural way the brain learns movement. Thus we use external focus like focusing on your partner, target of your movement, or imagery to allow the motor cortex to learn best.</li>
		<li><strong>Explicit vs implicit learning:</strong> The textbook example is how football players are taught to come to stop from running with weight in their heels. The explicit way is the coach explaining all the aspects of the right alignment. Players tend to drill this repeatedly and keep failing to keep the weight in their heels. The implicit way is to put a wood block on the grass and to ask the players to to a stop with their knees barely touching it. They tend to now stop right on the first try with every body part perfectly aligned even though, they are not told about it. Similarly in dance, it’s easy to overload students with multiple corrections when there are more effective, implicit ways to teach.</li>
		<li><strong>Low vs. high bandwidth learning:</strong> Commonly, dance instructions asks students to repeat the same movement many times in the hopes of improving. This is low bandwidth because the motor cortex only experiences a narrow band of movement. High bandwidth learning is to do a variation of the movement. The motor cortex get a wider sampling of neural feedback and can quicker develop better motor plans.</li>
