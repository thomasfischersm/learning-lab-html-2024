  <h1>The Learning Lab Difference</h1>
  <h2>What Is The Learning Lab?</h2>
  <p>At The Learning Lab, we believe the best way to learn is by teaching others. Our unique method pairs students at different levels, allowing advanced students to teach beginners. As students master each mini-lesson, they become teachers themselves, solidifying their knowledge by passing it on to the next learner. It’s an approach that accelerates learning, increases engagement, and builds real-world skills—especially in a challenging subject like computer science.</p>
  <h2>Why The Learning Lab Approach Works for Programming</h2>
  <p>Programming is more than memorizing syntax—it’s problem-solving, debugging, and critical thinking. These skills are best developed through practice and feedback. Traditional lecture-based classes can leave students feeling isolated and frustrated, especially when a small error stands in the way of success.</p>
  <p>With our peer-based system, students can ask questions, receive real-time feedback, and correct mistakes before they become frustrating roadblocks. Our mentor-student pairing ensures personalized learning and continuous support. Whether you're just starting or preparing for a software engineering interview, The Learning Lab makes mastering coding more interactive, enjoyable, and effective.</p>
  <h2>Develop Soft Skills Alongside Programming Expertise</h2>
  <p>Programming expertise is crucial, but so are soft skills—especially when it comes to landing that job. Many tech professionals struggle with articulating their thought process during interviews. At The Learning Lab, our peer-to-peer teaching format encourages continuous conversation and explanation, sharpening both technical and communication skills. You’ll be prepared not just to code, but to explain your approach with confidence in technical interviews.</p>

  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I'm Thomas Fischer, a self-taught software engineer with over two decades of experience in the tech industry, including positions at Google and Meta. I've interviewed over a hundred engineers and reviewed countless interview packets, giving me unique insights into what hiring committees look for. I have found that you learn more by implementing something yourself than memorizing textbooks, e.g. I've built my own database. However, self-learning can involve many detours and struggles. I believe the best way to learn computer science is through hands-on implementation combined with guided support to avoid unnecessary frustrations. In my free time, I enjoy practicing acroyoga and dancing sensual bachata.</p>
