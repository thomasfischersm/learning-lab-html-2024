  <h1>What is Acroyoga?</h1>
  <p>Acroyoga might surprise you! While it shares the word "yoga" in its name, it's a different beast entirely. Forget holding static stretches – acroyoga is all about <b>dynamic movement, playful exploration, and building trust with a partner.</b></p>
  <p><b>Imagine a thrilling fusion of acrobatics and partner work:</b> You'll work together to create exciting poses where one person (the flyer) is lifted and supported by the other (the base). It can be as basic as a playful "bird pose" (aka "airplane" with little kids) or progress to more challenging inversions and transitions.</p>
  </p>
  <h2>Unveiling the Acroyoga Universe:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>L-Base Vs. Standing:</b> In L-Base, the base lies on their back with the hands and arms free to move the flyer through the air. In Standing, the base stands, allowing the flyer to fly higher and also around the body of the base. (Standing includes dance lifts.)</li>
    <li><b>Solar vs. Lunar:</b> Solar, like the sun, is an acroyoga practice that’s very energetic and circus like. Lunar, like the moon, is a practice that’s calming, relaxing, and healing.(Lunar includes Thai yoga.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Safety First: Your Acroyoga Journey Starts Here</h1>
  <p>We understand your concerns.  Acroyoga involves trust and learning new skills. Here's what sets your mind at ease:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Honest Risk Assessment:</b> Acroyoga has inherent risks, similar to most physical activities. We prioritize safety with proper progressions and techniques.</li>
    <li><b>Spotters Are Your Superheroes:</b> Spotters are always present, guiding you safely in case of imbalance.</li>
    <li><b>Learn to Fall Gracefully:</b> We teach "bailing" techniques – safely falling out of poses – preparing you for unexpected situations.</li>
    <li><b>Building Confidence Step-by-Step:</b> No crazy stunts! You'll progress gradually through safe and fun poses with supportive instruction.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Accidents do happen in the community. The risk increases dramatically when doing advanced skills without training on your own and without a spotter.</p>

  <h1>What To Expect In Your First Class</h1>
  <!--
  <p><b>Feeling nervous?</b> Don't worry! Acroyoga is more about technique than strength.<br/>
    <strong>Can you hold a push-up?</strong> You're probably good to go!</p>
  <p><strong>Arrive early!</strong> This lets us get to know you and answer any questions you have.</p>
  <p><strong>The class starts with introductions!</strong> We'll go around the circle, sharing names, acro experience (if any) and a fun fact (like favorite beach). This helps build a friendly atmosphere for working with partners.</p>
  <p><strong>Next comes the warm-up!</strong> We'll either do acro-specific exercises or movement explorations to get your body ready.</p>
  <p><strong>Safety first!</strong> We'll review the three key safety rules before diving into acroyoga practice.</p>
  <p><strong>Your first flight will be unique!</strong> Some folks start slow, building trust by gently leaning on their partner. Even basic poses can feel like big achievements!</p>
  <p><strong>Advanced movers welcome!</strong> We've had students with strong movement backgrounds progress quickly.</p>
  <p><strong>Ready to take flight? Sign up today!</strong></p>
-->
  <p><strong>Preparing for your first acroyoga</strong> class may feel daunting, especially if you're unsure about your fitness level. Rest assured, acroyoga isn't just for the super strong or flexible. In fact, technique plays a bigger role than brute strength in achieving those awe-inspiring poses you've seen online. As a general rule, if you can hold a push-up position, you're good to go.</p>
  <p><strong>Arriving a little early</strong> gives us a chance to chat and understand your acro and movement background better. This allows me to tailor the class to the students present.</p>
  <p>We kick off each class with an <strong>opening circle where everyone introduces themselves</strong>, shares their acro experience, and answers a fun question. It's a great way to break the ice and get to know your fellow practitioners.</p>
  <p><strong>Warm-ups vary</strong> between acro-specific exercises and movement explorations.</p>
  <p>Following warm-ups, we <strong>review the three fundamental safety rules</strong> before diving into the practice.</p>
  <p>Your first acroyoga experience can <strong>range from gentle exploration to surprising feats.</strong> Whether you're taking your first steps into trust-building exercises or breezing through levels, there's a place for everyone in our class.</p>

  <p>Joining our sessions is easy:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Register:</strong> Simply click the Eventbrite link to secure your spot.</li>
    <li><strong>Stay Informed:</strong> Look out for an email on the day of the session for the exact studio location. Usually, we gather at Ripley-Grier, 520 8th Ave, NYC, NY 10018, but occasionally it's at a nearby Ripley-Grier location.</li>
    <li><strong>Dress Appropriately:</strong> Wear snug fitting clothes. No loops, loose fabric, or other things that can get caught. Yoga pants and a snug t-shirt/top are perfect. For guys, avoid shorts with slippery fabrics!</li>
    <li><strong>Arrive Early:</strong> Plan to come 15 minutes before class. This will give you enough time to get through security, which can have long lines, and to locate the correct studio.</li>
    <li><strong>No Partner, No Problem:</strong> You don't need a partner to join, and beginners are highly encouraged to participate.</li>
    <li><strong>Final Sales:</strong> Please note all ticket sales are final. We try our best to accommodate refunds or reschedules if they are requested at least a day before.

  <p>Here's a glimpse of the major milestones you'll encounter along the way:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Learning First Poses:</strong> Begin with beginner-friendly poses, such as Bird (aka "airplane"), to get your toes wet.</li>
    <li><strong>Side Star:</strong> Transition into more challenging territory with Side Star, a pose resembling the yoga half-moon performed atop another person. Expect to dedicate multiple sessions to master this fundamental pose, which serves as a gateway to a myriad of other poses and transitions.</li>
    <li><strong>Star:</strong> Delve into inversions with the Star pose. Developing the ability to base or fly in the Star position is pivotal for mastering inversions and refining your skills in acroyoga.</li>
    <li><strong>Ninja Star:</strong> Often the first serious washing machine practitioners encounter. A washing machine is a sequence of poses where the start and end are the same, creating a continuous flow akin to being in a washing machine.</li>
    <li><strong>Four-Step:</strong> Challenge yourself with the Four-Step washing machine, marking your graduation from being a beginner.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>After these, student's journey split into unique directions, shaped by your aspirations and interests. A common next big goal is to master standing hand-to-hand poses.</p>

  <h1>Intro To Acroyoga Technique</h1>
  <p>In acroyoga, it's not just about muscle power—it's about mastering technique. Here's a sneak peek into the key concepts you'll explore in class:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Bone-Stacking:</strong> Imagine aligning your body like building blocks—each bone and joint perfectly stacked atop the other. Think of it as finding your balance point where your skeletal structure does most of the work. Try this: Stand as if waiting for the subway, then transition into a chair pose (hovering above an imaginary seat). Hold each for five minutes and feel the difference in muscle engagement.</li>
    <li><strong>"The flyer holds the shape. The base balances":</strong> In any acroyoga pose, the flyer maintains the shape while the base focuses on balance. By locking in their body position, the flyer avoids creating an echo chamber of twitches and adjustments between the base and the flyer.</li>
    <li><strong>Postural sway:</strong> If you try to stand a stick on an end, you’ll notice that it keeps falling. Any tall and narrow object quickly falls. Why do humans not fall over? We actually continuously fall one way and another. We balance by continually falling. Try to hold your shoulder still standing next to a door frame. You can’t. When bases tend to fall over like a stick, it’s because they try to freeze the position and suppress their postural sway. We help you to unblock the impulse to suppress your postural sway.</li>
  </ol>

<article class="content" id="solo-train">
  <h1>How to Solo Train For Acroyoga</h1>
  <p>Not required, but some students are looking for ways to improve their acro-readdiness on their own in between sessions. Here are some ideas:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Plank Variations:</strong> Develops body tension for flyers. For bases, pretend the world is flipped over and you are basing the planet itself. Slowly transition the flyer (= planet) from one hand to the other to avoid disturing the delicate balance of your imanginary flyer.</li>
    <li><strong>Hamstring Stretches:</strong> Many beginning bases struggle with tight hamstrings. Tip: Focus on scanning for butt muscles that you may be holding and stretch under load instead of simply dangle.</li>
    <li><strong>Slow and smooth transitions:</strong> The heart of acroyoga is transitioning from one bonestack to the next. You can practice transitions with your own bodyweight by moving between downard dog, crab, monkey, and other positions. Focus on slow and smooth!
    <li><strong>Slow and smooth locomotion:</strong> Locomotion is taking transitions to the next level by moving over distance: Bear walks, frog hops, crab crawls, and so on are really great. If you make a sound, you are not smooth!</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Note: I have adapted GMB training to class warm-ups. When we do them, students perform noticably better in class.</p>

  <h1>The Learning Lab Teaching Format</h1>
  <p><strong>Currently in the group class format:</strong> We are paving the way to develop a community of dancers at different levels. Once we’ve built that, we’ll convert to the learning lab format like we’ve done for Argentine Tango.</p>
  <p><strong>A structured approach:</strong> Unlike typical peer-to-peer learning experiences where peers are often unsure on what to do, the learning lab format is structured to be productive. The asymmetric pairing of a more beginning with a more advanced student means that the mentor takes charge and knows where to go. A curriculum designed for bite-sized, progressive mini-lessons provides a clear path forward.</p>
  <p><strong>Teaching as Learning:</strong> Why teach without compensation? It's simple - teaching is an integral part of your learning journey. Articulating concepts, answering questions, and addressing learners' challenges enriches your understanding and enhances self-esteem as you contribute to others' growth.</p>
  <p><strong>Addressing Accuracy Concerns:</strong> Worried about learning incorrect techniques? Our mini-lessons have clearly defined, tangible goals. Achieving these goals is a mutual indicator of successful learning. Moreover, both students and mentors have access to uniform teaching notes and resources through our companion app, ensuring consistency and accuracy in teaching.</p>
  <p><strong>Supported by a Dedicated App:</strong> To enhance the Learning Lab experience, our app houses the curriculum, lesson videos, and tracks your progress. It's a handy tool for communication and determining your next learning steps. Explore it here: <a href="https://learninglab.fans">learninglab.fans</a></p>

  <h1>About Thomas</h1>
  <p>One of the first things that you notice about me is that my neck doesn’t move much. I fractured my cervical spine, and it is completely fused now. I also have knee damage, ankle damage, and a shoulder surgery. I don’t look like the most elegant and highly skilled acrobat. Dealing with my injuries and limitations taught me a lot about how to adapt the practice to my body. And that experience helps me adapt the acroyoga practice to the various needs, challenges, and limitations of my students.</p>
  <p>I fell in love with acroyoga at first sight. It took me a while to find the first class and then a regular class to go to. Chris Filkin’s epic three-hour Friday class with intensive technique and technical progressions informed a lot of my approach. Living within walking distance of the legendary Santa Monica jam on the beach certainly helped as well. Further, anatomy classes, Thai yoga certifications, and professional bodywork training helped develop my understanding of how bodies move.</p>
  <p>My main passion lies in developing the learning lab format (learning from one student and teaching the next with a structured curriculum). I co-developed it with Mitra Martin for Argentine Tango in Los Angeles. The original learning lab is still running and has expanded. My desire is to bring it to acroyoga and other learning disciplines as well as further develop it and build a mobile platform to support it.</p>
  <p>Alysa Malgapo has been in strumental in starting the acroyoga learning lab. She still comes to teach occasionally, but her dental hygiene schedule and wait-listed yoga classes keep her busy. She is very personable and makes sure that Thomas doesn’t get too serious ;)</p>
