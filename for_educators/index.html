  <h1>Learning Labs Are An Innovative Learning Format</h1>
  <p>Core concept:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Learn and teach:</b> Students learn a lesson from a more advanced student and then teach it to a more beginning student.</li>
    <li><b>Curriculum:</b> Peer-teachable mini-lessons</li>
    <li><b>An app:</b> Track your progress and pair up with other students</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Example:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Alita walks into a salsa learning lab.</li>
    <li>The instructor pairs Alita to learn the first lesson from Petra.</li>
    <li>Petra shows Alita how to do the basic step.<!-- (Because everyone learns at a different pace, Petra takes all the time Alita needs. And when Alita is ready moves on to the finer points.)--></li>
    <li>Now that Alita knows it, she can teach it to Hector walking fresh into the door.<!--(The process of teaching Hector makes Alita gain deeper understanding herself.)--></li>
    <li>Alita checks her app and finds the next mentor to learn the second lesson from.</li>

  <h1>Benefits For Students</h1>
  <h2 style="margin-block-end: 0.2em;">#1 Go at your own pace. Start anytime.</h2>
  <p style="margin-block-start: 0.2em;">All you need is a mentoring student. You pick the next lesson.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-block-end: 0.2em;">#2 Hands-on instruction, guidance, and feedback</h2>
  <p style="margin-block-start: 0.2em;">Instructors in a group class have many students. You have the full attention of your mentoring student to be shown instruction hands-on, ask questions, and get feedback.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-block-end: 0.2em;">#3 Feel real progress</h2>
  <p style="margin-block-start: 0.2em;">Classes can feel like you are endlessly showing up and make vague progress. With a learning lab, you see the curriculum ahead of you and can check off one mini-lesson after the next.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-block-end: 0.2em;">#4 Mastery through teaching</h2>
  <p style="margin-block-start: 0.2em;">Being exposed to material is one thing. Teaching it to another student develops a much deeper understanding.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-block-end: 0.2em;">#5 Make friends</h2>
  <p style="margin-block-start: 0.2em;">Form meaningful friendships through in-depth learning interactions with peers.</p>
</article>
<article class="content" id="educator-benefits">
  <h1>Benefits For Educators</h1>
  <h2 style="margin-block-end: 0.2em;">#1 Higher student retention</h2>
  <p style="margin-block-start: 0.2em;">because students form friendships when they teach each other</p>

  <h2 style="margin-block-end: 0.2em;">#2 Students learn many times faster</h2>
  <p style="margin-block-start: 0.2em;">Hands-on instruction, individual pacing, and frequent feedback of mentors adds up to a lot.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-block-end: 0.2em;">#3 Focus on higher level teaching</h2>
  <p style="margin-block-start: 0.2em;">Let peer mentors handle the easy stuff. Focus on where your teaching expertise is really needed.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-block-end: 0.2em;">#4 Design the full learning journey</h2>
  <p style="margin-block-start: 0.2em;">With drop-in classes, you have to focus on making a class for whoever shows up that day. With learning labs, everyone starts at the first lesson and can continue where they left of whenver they come back. That let's you focus on the whole student journey.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-block-end: 0.2em;">#5 Rapid iteration and refinement</h2>
  <p style="margin-block-start: 0.2em;">The unit of a learning lab is two students and a 15-minute lesson. It's so quick and easy that it lets you test out lessons on students, incorprate their feedback, and iterate quickly.</p>

<article class="content" id="cocnerns">
  <h1>Common Concerns</h1>
  <h2 style="margin-block-end: 0.2em;">#1 "Why would anyone teach for free?"</h2>
  <p style="margin-block-start: 0.2em;">Students quickly realize how much they learn from teaching and love the self esteem boost of being able to contribute to another student's learning. Plus, it's the pay-it-forwad model of receiving mentoring in exchange for mentoring.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-block-end: 0.2em;">#2 How do I know a peer mentor is teaching correctly?</h2>
  <p style="margin-block-start: 0.2em;">Everyone has access to the lesson notes and can check the mentor. Plus, lessons are designed around a task or outcome. Successfully accomplishing that lesson goal is verification itself.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-block-end: 0.2em;">#3 I want to learn from a real teacher!</h2>
  <p style="margin-block-start: 0.2em;">1:1 from a real teacher is ideal, but affordable from everyone. Peer mentors, with a well-structured curriculum, provide more guidance and feedback than a teacher in front of a large classes.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-block-end: 0.2em;">#5 Won’t this put me out of a job as a teacher?</h2>
  <p style="margin-block-start: 0.2em;">Your role shifts from lecturing to guiding, creating curriculum, and supporting students as they teach. You gain more time to focus on higher-level aspects and more holistic student development.</p>
</article>
<article class="content" id="concepts">
  <h1>Key Concepts to Understand</h1>
  <h2 style="margin-block-end: 0.2em;">Learning Edge</h2>
  <p style="margin-block-start: 0.2em;">Traditional classes have a single topic and fixed pace, leaving many only mildly engaged. In a learning lab each student pair has their own topic and pace, keeping each student right at the edge of their learning.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-block-end: 0.2em;">Asymmetric Learning</h2>
  <p style="margin-block-start: 0.2em;">Students learn faster when taught by someone with mastery over a skill, avoiding the pitfalls of “beginners teaching beginners.”</p>

  <h2 style="margin-block-end: 0.2em;">"A person right in front of you"</h2>
  <p style="margin-block-start: 0.2em;">A peer mentor can easily pick up on a learner’s struggles or confusion and adjust in real-time—no falling through the cracks.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-block-end: 0.2em;">Pointability</h2>
  <p style="margin-block-start: 0.2em;">A clear curriculum lets students easily identify lessons they need, eliminating the "What should we do next?" dilemma.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-block-end: 0.2em;">Elastic Lessons</h2>
  <p style="margin-block-start: 0.2em;">Lessons are adaptable, allowing mentors to keep it easy for struggling learners and dive deeper for faster learners (and lesson repetitions).</p>

  <h1>How To Get Started As An Educator</h1>
  <ul>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.4em"><b>Step #1: Start with a small trial.</b><br/>Start with a workshop or class segment in your existing class (a curriculum of 1-4 mini-lessons).</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.4em"><b>Step #2: Create a visual breakdown of the subject</b><br/>Writing everything you want to teach on post-it notes and spreading them out on the floor is a great way to do that.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.4em"><b>Step #3: Translate teaching topics into peer-mentoring friendly lessons.</b><br/>Mentors are bad at and don't enjoy regurgitating talking points. Make the core of a lesson a skill, ability, or outcome. Bad examples: List ten market segmentation dimensions, explain the Versailles Treaty. Good examples: Analyze your last coffee purchase for market positioning, show how to start a car on a hill.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.4em"><b>Step #4: Enter your curriculum into the app</b><br/>(You don't have to do all up front. You can fill lessons in as the fastest student gets close.)</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.4em"><b>Step #5: Test and refine</b><br/>Test lessons with students, refine based on feedback, and iterate them quickly.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.4em"><b>Step #6: Run your classes as learning labs.</b><br/>Pair students with the app. Track their progress in the app. Walk around the room to nurture your learning community.</li>

  <h1>How to design peer-mentor suitable mini-lessons</h1>
  <ul>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.4em"><b>Less one-way lecture, more interactive</b><br/>Unlike traditional teaching, peer mentors thrive on hands-on, task-based lessons. Center a lesson around an ability, outcome, or exercise.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.4em"><b>Small, concrete lessons</b><br/>Mentors are inspired when they have a small, concrete teaching task.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.4em"><b>From information to abilities</b><br/>Shift from transferring information to students to developing abilities in students (e.g. critical analysis of historic sources).</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 0.4em"><b>Test on students</b><br/>It's hard to anticipate how students react to teaching lessons. Try them out, incorporate, and iterate. Expect to redo a lesson 2-3 times until it clicks with students.</li>

  <h1>Neuroscience-Based Teaching</h1>
  <p>Since the publication of the Code of Terpsichore in 1830, dance has been taught in the way that you are most likely familiar with. The instructor wants a certain movement and tells you to move that way. You have probably realized that simply because someone logically explains you how to move can be far away from actually performing the move. Over the last two decades, neuroscience through rigorous studies and brain imaging developed an understanding about how we optimally learn movement/dance.</p>
  <p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Internal vs. external focus:</strong> Internal focus is when you think about the muscles and joints that you want to move. External focus is when you focus on the goal of your movement, your partner, or imagery. Think about driving down a windy mountain road. You can focus on your hands or get consumed in tracing the curves of the road. The latter will make your movements smooth, fluid, and precise because you allow the motor cortex to work out how to best employ your muscles.</li>
    <li><strong>Explicit vs implicit learning:</strong> Explicit learning happens when instruction specifies all the details of the movement. Implicit learning happens when instruction specifies a strategic goal guiding the student to acquire the movement details correctly without thinking about them.</li>
    <li><strong>Low vs. high bandwidth learning:</strong> Low bandwidth learning is repetition of the same movement. High bandwidth learning is variation of related movements. The motor cortext learns movement by making a plan and then evaluating the success. More variation provides the motor cortex with richer data to draw insights from.</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <!--<h1>Neuroscience-Based Teaching</h1>
  <p>Today, the standard in bachata dance instruction is still based on an instructor wanting a student to move in a certain way and telling the student to move in that way. Over the last two decades, two hundred scientific studies have shed light on how humans learn movement and dance best. Confirmed in many studies, small changes in teaching can increase learning by 50% and more significant changes can make students learn five times faster!</p>
	<p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Internal vs. external focus:</strong> Most people can walk into a dance studio perfectly fine. However, when they are asked to dance forward, left-right-left-right, they become stiff and get confused after every step on which foot to use next. What’s happening is cognitive interference. When you think about the body parts that you move (= internal focus), you interfere with the natural way the brain learns movement. Thus we use external focus like focusing on your partner, target of your movement, or imagery to allow the motor cortex to learn best.</li>
		<li><strong>Explicit vs implicit learning:</strong> The textbook example is how football players are taught to come to stop from running with weight in their heels. The explicit way is the coach explaining all the aspects of the right alignment. Players tend to drill this repeatedly and keep failing to keep the weight in their heels. The implicit way is to put a wood block on the grass and to ask the players to to a stop with their knees barely touching it. They tend to now stop right on the first try with every body part perfectly aligned even though, they are not told about it. Similarly in dance, it’s easy to overload students with multiple corrections when there are more effective, implicit ways to teach.</li>
		<li><strong>Low vs. high bandwidth learning:</strong> Commonly, dance instructions asks students to repeat the same movement many times in the hopes of improving. This is low bandwidth because the motor cortex only experiences a narrow band of movement. High bandwidth learning is to do a variation of the movement. The motor cortex get a wider sampling of neural feedback and can quicker develop better motor plans.</li>

  <h1>The Learning Lab Teaching Format</h1>
  <p><strong>Currently in the group class format:</strong> We are paving the way to develop a community of dancers at different levels. Once we’ve built that, we’ll convert to the learning lab format like we’ve done for Argentine Tango.</p>
    <p><strong>A structured approach:</strong> Unlike typical peer-to-peer learning experiences where peers are often unsure on what to do, the learning lab format is structured to be productive. The asymmetric pairing of a more beginning with a more advanced student means that the mentor takes charge and knows where to go. A curriculum designed for bite-sized, progressive mini-lessons provides a clear path forward.</p>
    <p><strong>Teaching as Learning:</strong> Why teach without compensation? It's simple - teaching is an integral part of your learning journey. Articulating concepts, answering questions, and addressing learners' challenges enriches your understanding and enhances self-esteem as you contribute to others' growth.</p>
    <p><strong>Addressing Accuracy Concerns:</strong> Worried about learning incorrect techniques? Our mini-lessons have clearly defined, tangible goals. Achieving these goals is a mutual indicator of successful learning. Moreover, both students and mentors have access to uniform teaching notes and resources through our companion app, ensuring consistency and accuracy in teaching.</p>
    <p><strong>Supported by a Dedicated App:</strong> To enhance the Learning Lab experience, our app houses the curriculum, lesson videos, and tracks your progress. It's a handy tool for communication and determining your next learning steps. Explore it here: <a href="https://learninglab.fans">learninglab.fans</a><</p>

  <h1>About Thomas</h1>
  <p>Thomas was not born a natural dancer. In fact, with a software engineering mindset that considered the body merely a mechanism to transport the brain around and a fractured/fused cervical spine, he started his dance journey on the opposite end.</p>
  <p>Yet he has discovered the joy of feeling the music, discovering the delight of moving the body, letting emotions take over the movement, and accessing a much deeper and richer way of being by embracing the whole human experience.</p>
  <p>There were many obstacles to overcome and are still ahead. His joy in teaching comes from supporting students pass those hurdles. For example, when a new dancer takes the first creative risks to inject their own ideas into the dance, they often feel timid about making a mistake or looking awkward. Yet when the do it, they have these big smiles.</p>
  <p>If you need to know stats. About six years ago, I co-developed the learning lab with Mitra Martin for Argenine Tango, which is still running in Los Angeles multiple days a week. About a year ago, he started teaching the learning labs for sensual bachata and acroyoga. They are still being taught in the traditional format and have to build a more diverse community of recurring students before converting to the learning lab format. He also took the sensual bachata instructor training with Sensual Movement.</p>
